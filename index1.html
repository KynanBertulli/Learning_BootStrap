    Learning BootStrap 

    Grid System is the most important thing when learning with bootstrap
    way of placing elements on your page
    horizontal and vertical lines
    • takes entire page into 12 columns w/ some space in between
    • a row can also hold all 12 columns

    must first create container class when you want to place a container
    then create a row within container
    use .call class to create column

     <div class ="col-md-6"> defines the type of screen we are working with
         md, lg, xl
        -6 defines how many columsn the row takes..
    container > row > divs
    goal of bootstrap is to create responsive websites on all devices

    grid classes:
    5 grid classes(xs,sm,md,lg,xl)
        col-            devices less than 576px
        col-sm-         devices greater than 576 px
        col-md-         devices greater than 768 px
        col-lg-         devices greater than 992 px
        col-xl-         devices greater than 1200 px
    
    we can use different grid classes at once to support multiple devices..
    <div class ="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
