    Learning about grid Layouts in Bootstrap:

    we can create different layouts for md devices and large devices

    understandig how to create layouts on multiple devices is about understanding ratios
    if each box each takes 6 columns in a large screen 6 + 6 is 1:1 so two box on each row

    but when we want to create a medium layout where the second box on each row shrinks by half
    it would need to be 8:4 increasing from 6 still keeps the box at the same size because the ratio of screen is the same.
